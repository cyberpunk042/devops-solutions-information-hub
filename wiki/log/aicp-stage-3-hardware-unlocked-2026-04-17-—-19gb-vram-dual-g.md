# AICP Stage 3 hardware unlocked 2026-04-17 — 19GB VRAM dual-GPU

## Summary

AICP hardware capacity confirmed at 19GB VRAM (RTX 2080 8GB + RTX 2080 Ti 11GB) on 2026-04-17. This is the planned Stage 3 hardware threshold called out in Model — Local AI: 'The planned upgrade to 19GB unlocks Stage 3: running complex agent reasoning locally, which is the step that moves the routing split from ~40% local to ~80% local.' Status: capacity in place; empirical routing split measurement is the next operational step (still pending, but no longer blocked by hardware). Models now runnable that were previously hardware-blocked: Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE (17GB / 18GB+ VRAM), Gemma 4 26B MoE (16.8GB / 18GB+ VRAM). The dual-gpu profile in config/profiles/dual-gpu.yaml becomes runnable. Open question 'Empirical routing split after Stage 3' from Model — Local AI is now answerable in principle — measurement work tracked under AICP Step 9 of the second-brain adoption plan.
